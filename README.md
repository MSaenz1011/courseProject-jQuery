# Initial Proyect

**Description**

Project based on the creating of a form that allows a user to put or fill his favorite character, regardless of this person is either fictional or non-fictional

**Technologies**

The following technologies will be this:

*HTML*
*CSS (Tailwind will be used)*
*jQuery*
*Node.JS*
*Express*
*MongoDB*

Ideally, this project needs to create a database using SQL. However, due to only doing a GET and POST request and using a single schema (the favorite character), there is no need **to do a complex model*, besides Mongo is on the cloud (Mongo Atlas), which makes this a bit easier for me

**Current Progress**

Project has a basic HTML and some CSS. The idea is that in two weeks the full funcionality will be reached and the creation or a basic setup in on the database should be created.

Due to this being a form, the validations are going to be simple and pretty straightfoward.

By the second week of April, both the petitions on the front-end and the data stored in the back-end should work with no problems
