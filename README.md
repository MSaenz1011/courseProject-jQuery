# Initial Proyect

**Description**

Project based on a form that allows the user to put or fill his favorite character.

**Technologies**

The following technologies will be this:

- **HTML**
- **CSS** (Tailwind will be used)
- **jQuery**
- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB**

Ideally, this project needs to create a database using SQL. However, due to only doing a GET and POST request and using a single schema (the favorite character), there is no need **to do a complex model*, besides Mongo is on the cloud (Mongo Atlas), which makes this a bit easier for me.

jQuery will be used to, as the principles of jQuery says, to "do more, write less". Most likely, the forEach() method will be used a lot (for the GET petition) and instead of using the function () {} synthax, will try to use the arrow function ( () ==> {} )

**Current Progress**

Styles added and an Api request is made to the Super Hero Api (https://superheroapi.com). 

Needs the creation of the MongoDB server, as well the creation of the node.js services (the endpoint through Express, CORS, etc.)
